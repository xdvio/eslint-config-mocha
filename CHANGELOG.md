# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project DOES NOT adhere to Semantic Versioning. New rules may be added in minor versions that cause previously passing code to fail linting. That is working as intended, since the benefits of stricter rules that automatically get introduced when using Dependabot usually outweigh the inconvenience of infrequently having to update code to follow a stricter standard (or adding a `/*eslint-disable*/` comment).

## [Unreleased]

## 1.0.0

Initial release of `eslint-config-mocha`, with rules for `mocha` and `chai-as-promised`.
